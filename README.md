<br/> 
Spreadsheet 1: ShellThickness<br/> 
Data used in all analyses with shell thickness and length as response variables.<br/> 
Index = Lagoon site<br/> 
ID = Individual shell ID<br/> 
L = Length measured in mm<br/> 
H = Height measured in mm<br/> 
W = Width measured in mm<br/> 
Weight = Measured in grams<br/> 
STI = Shell thickness index calculated (1000 x Weight / (Length * (Height ^2 + Width ^2)^0.5*PI()/2) <br/> 
Lat = Latitude<br/> 
Long = Longitude<br/> 
Year = Year of collection<br/> 
Location = Country level<br/> 
<br/> 
Spreadsheet 2: Shape<br/> 
Data used for shape analyses<br/> 
Index = Lagoon site<br/> 
ID = Individual shell ID<br/> 
h#x/h#y = Harmonic pairs to quantify geometric information for use in principa component analyses (PCA)<br/> 
PC# = Principal components extracted from PCA capturing shape variation<br/> 
<br/> 
Spreadsheet 3: Periostracum<br/> 
Measurements of the periostracum made on scanning electron micrographs using ImageJ.<br/> 
Index = Lagoon site<br/> 
Thickness = Periostracum thickness measured in micrometers<br/>
