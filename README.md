Dataset analysed in the study "Low salinity limits size and affects shell thickness and shape in the lagoon cockle, Cerastoderma glaucum, in the Baltic Sea"

Baltic_glaucum_dataset.xls

Spreadsheet 1: ShellThickness
Data used in all analyses with shell thickness and length as response variables.
Index = Lagoon site
ID = Individual shell ID
L = Length measured in mm
H = Height measured in mm
W = Width measured in mm
Weight = Measured in grams
STI = Shell thickness index calculated (1000 x Weight / (Length * (Height ^2 + Width ^2)^0.5*PI()/2) 
Lat = Latitude
Long = Longitude
Year = Year of collection
Location = Country level

Spreadsheet 2: Shape
Data used for shape analyses
Index = Lagoon site
ID = Individual shell ID
h#x/h#y = Harmonic pairs to quantify geometric information for use in principa component analyses (PCA)
PC# = Principal components extracted from PCA capturing shape variation

Spreadsheet 3: Periostracum
Measurements of the periostracum made on scanning electron micrographs using ImageJ.
Index = Lagoon site
Thickness = Periostracum thickness measured in micrometers
